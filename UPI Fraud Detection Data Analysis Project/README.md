# UPI Fraud Detection Data Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data to detect fraudulent activities using data science and machine learning techniques. Through this analysis, we identify patterns in fraudulent transactions and build a predictive model to flag potential fraud in real-time.

## Introduction

The rise of digital payments has made financial transactions quicker and more convenient. UPI, which has grown significantly in India, has been subject to fraudulent activities. This project addresses the need for early fraud detection in UPI transactions to protect users and maintain the integrity of financial systems.

By analyzing transaction data, this project develops a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on various features such as transaction amount, time, and merchant type.

## Objectives

The key objectives of the project are:
1. Understand the distribution and patterns within UPI transaction data.
2. Identify the key features that differentiate legitimate from fraudulent transactions.
3. Propose strategies for enhancing UPI transaction security.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains UPI transaction-level information, including:
- `Transaction_ID`: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- `amount`: Transaction value.
- `timestamp`: Date and time of the transaction.
- `fraud`: Label (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent).
- `Merchant_Catagory`: Category of the merchant involved.
- `Location`: Location of the transaction.

**Note**: The dataset is not included in the repository due to confidentiality. You will need to supply your own dataset or request access to a public UPI dataset.
